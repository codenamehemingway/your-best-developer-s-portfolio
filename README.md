# Welcome to your-best-developer-s-portfolio!

## Reason for this repo: As a developer I want to show off my work to potential employers so that they can assess the quality and type of work I can do to see if I am a good fit for their company.

# Please review and notice the following features of this page:

## WHEN you load my portfolio

## THEN you are presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

## WHEN you click one of the links in the navigation

## THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

## WHEN you click on the link to the section about my work

## THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

## WHEN you click on the images of the applications

## THEN you are taken to that deployed application

## WHEN you resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices

## THEN you are presented with a responsive layout that adapts to your viewport

# My site is published at: https://codenamehemingway.github.io/your-best-developer-s-portfolio/
